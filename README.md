# 🌠 Meteor Madness

## 📌 Overview

**Meteor Madness** is a meteor tracking and analysis project focused on detecting, monitoring, and studying meteor activity. The project aims to analyze meteor trajectories, estimate speed and origin, and provide insights into meteor showers using observational data and computational methods.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Track meteor activity using observational data
* Analyze meteor speed, trajectory, and possible origin
* Predict meteor showers using historical datasets
* Visualize meteor paths and impact probabilities
* Spread awareness about astronomy and space science

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* NumPy / Pandas (Data Analysis)
* Matplotlib / Plotly (Visualization)
* OpenCV (if using camera detection)
* Astronomy APIs (optional)

---

## 📊 Features

* 📡 Meteor detection and tracking
* 📈 Trajectory analysis
* 🌍 Data visualization dashboards
* 🔍 Historical meteor shower analysis
* 📅 Prediction modeling

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Collect meteor observation data (manual entry, telescope, or camera feed).
2. Process and clean the data.
3. Apply mathematical models to calculate trajectory and velocity.
4. Visualize results using graphs and plots.
5. Generate insights and predictions.
